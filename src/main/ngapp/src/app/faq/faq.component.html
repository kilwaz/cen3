              For the Mehndi night we have chosen for this to be a young adults evening only to allow this to be an informal party for friends and family to meet prior to the wedding day.
              Children are welcome to the Wedding and Reception but we kindly ask to please keep noise to a minimum during
              the Civil Ceremony. Activity packs will be provided in the evening to help keep them occupied!

            You will have around 2 hours to relax (4pm-6pm) between the events of the day. You are welcome to stay in
            the
            venue where there will be lots of seating and refreshments available.
            Alternatively if you have a hotel booked nearby, feel free to go back and get ready for the evening events!

              For the Mehndi night we have kept the dress code informal - you can wear Western or Traditional Indian dress as you prefer.
              <br/>For the civil ceremony - this is a Western event so we ask as many guests as possible to wear Suit and Tie/Western dresses.
              <br/>For the reception - this is an Indian event so we ask as many guests as possible to wear Tradition
              Indian dress or Formal attire.
              <br/>Do not worry if you do not have the correct attire for the event - all guests are not expected to change between events!
              For those who will be changing from Western attire to Indian attire for the evening, there will be
              changing rooms provided at the venue between 4pm-6pm to use if you do not have a hotel room nearby.
